# Dyn-GWN: Time-Series Forecasting using Time-varying Graphs with Applications to Finance and Traffic Prediction

This is the offical repo of the ICAIF 2023 paper **Dyn-GWN: Time-Series Forecasting using Time-varying Graphs with Applications to Finance and Traffic Prediction**

Dyn-GWN is an adaptation of [GWN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00121) for dynamic graphs.

## Requirements
This code has been tested with PyTorch 2.0.


## Structure of the repo
Scripts to run the algorithms are located in `scripts/`. The current code supports the following datasets: 
Financial: Stock Volatility, 
Traffic: METR-LA, PEMS-BAY.
